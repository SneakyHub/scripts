# scripts
These scripts were made for my own use maybe you can get some use out of them. they'll be super basic but it's whatever if you wanna improve my scripts go right ahead and post them on here :)


# Requirements

- Was built to run on Ubuntu 18.04 64 bit ( may work on other flavors but use with caution ) 

# Setup

1. sudo chmod +x ptero-panel-updater.sh
 ( You can change the name to any other script to give it the required permissions )

2. ./ptero-panel-updater.sh <- this will run the script within your terminal
